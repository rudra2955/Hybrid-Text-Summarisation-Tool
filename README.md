# Hybrid-Text-Summarisation-Tool
This is a Python-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool designed to perform text summarization using both extractive and abstractive methods. It leverages spaCy for extractive summarization and pretrained models from Hugging Face Transformers (like T5 or BART) for high-quality abstractive summarization.
